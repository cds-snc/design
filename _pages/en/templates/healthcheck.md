The benefits of employee engagement are well [documented](https://www.kevinkruse.com/employee-engagement-research-master-list-of-29-studies/) The Canadian public service conducts  the [Public Service Employee Survey (PSES) annually](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey/2019-public-service-employee-survey-pses/highlights-2019-pses.html). This survey measures federal government employees’ opinions about their engagement, leadership, workforce, workplace, workplace well-being and compensation. The survey provides a lot of important [data](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey/2019-public-service-employee-survey-pses/highlights-2019-pses.html). However, the PSES results are released once a year, typically three to four months following the close of the survey.  

At CDS, similar to our delivery peers, we want regular feedback from our employees. In response, we implemented quarterly pulse check surveys to gain real-time insight into our employee experience. These fast and efficient surveys give employees an opportunity to provide feedback anonymously and are a great opportunity to ensure we are on the right track or need to course correct if something we’ve implemented isn’t well received.
