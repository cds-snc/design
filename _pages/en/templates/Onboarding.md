### Onboarding at CDS

As a growing organization, we onboard new employees almost every week. While this is something we do regularly, it’s a once in a lifetime experience for the employee starting. A new job can be stressful, and the decision to stick with a job or move on is often made within the first few days. It’s vital that we create a great onboarding experience. We never want to lose sight of the fact that people are at the heart of what we do.

Over the past year we’ve onboarded 36 new employees, almost doubling the staff at CDS. We’ve always been excited about adding new people to our team, but we knew that we needed to make improvements to our onboarding experience. How could we apply the techniques and tools we use to build technology to help us create something excellent? Turns out, it takes some research, some discovery, and some testing.
