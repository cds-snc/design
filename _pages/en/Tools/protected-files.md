*We put papers with protected personal information in a secure filing cabinet.*

### How to find the protected filing cabinet
Ask any talent team member for the location of the secure filing cabinet in your office. They'll also know how to operate the lock.

### What we put in the protected filing cabinet
Any printed material that's [protected information]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy), including:
- Employee rosters (including names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- Job interviewee notes or evaluations

### What we don't put in the cabinet
- You can store papers that aren't protected at your desk or in your locker.
- You can store protected, online information in [GC Docs]({{site.baseurl}}/gc-docs).
- Any non-protected files can go on [Google Drive]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive).
- Classified (like "secret" or "topic secret" documents) can't go in any of our systems or filing cabinets. Refer to TBS' guidance on handling it.

### Who uses the cabinet when
- **You are responsible for returning materials to the cabinet as soon as you're done using them.**
- You also need to make sure that it's locked when you're done using it.
