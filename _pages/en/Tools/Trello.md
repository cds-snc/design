*We use Trello to track talent team internal projects.*

### How to find Trello
- Log into Trello via your CDS Google account.
- View our ðŸ”’ [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/5Vl63uNc/talent).
- If you need to be able to edit cards, ask Andrea for an invitation.

### What we put on Trello
Trello is where we track basic information about ongoing, *non-staffing-specific details*. We track information like: 
- The name of the project (example: "progressions for delivery teams")
- Who's taking the lead on it and who is else is involved
- Notes on project progress
- Checklist of steps

### What we don't put on Trello
Like Google Drive, Trello can't hold [protected data]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy). Store this information in [GCDocs]({{site.baseurl}}/gc-docs) or our [secure filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/protected-files). 

### Who uses Trello when
- **Talent Team Members are responsible for updating their project cards.**
- Enter projects as you start working on them.
- Update the project card as you do work on the project.
- Move it to the current session column when you're done with it.
- We review all trello cards during our biweekly retro and backlog refinement meetings.

### Why do we do this?
Trello serves three purposes:
- It keeps us up to date of each others work. 
- It saves Andrea and others from asking what you're doing, when.
- We use it to check against our progress on ðŸ”’  [our key results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bfwmduz1ZQ6KCY0ELnqifSA8NLlTQ3JVNG2J2DTaLP0/edit#)
