*We put files with protected personal information on GCDocs.*

### How to get to GCDocs
- On your TBS computer, [navigate to our research folder directly].
- If you're not on the TBS network, you will have to connect to the VPN before your open GCDocs.

### Using GCDocs
- Store files in a sub-folder named after each employee. If one doesn’t already exist, you can add it yourself. (Click the add folder icon beside “Add Item”.)

#### Creating a new file

- Create the file (e.g., Word, Excel, or audio recording) on your TBS computer.
- Navigate to your product sub-folder.
- Press “Add item” → “Document”.
- Beside “Existing”, press “Choose File”. Choose the file from your TBS computer.
- Press “Add”. A new window will open.
- Fill out each required field (the ones labelled with a yellow caution triangle):
    - Document type: press the small black triangle; a new window will open, choose the type that best describes your document (e.g. “Dataset” or “Notes”).
    - Language: choose the language of your file.
    - Classification: Protected A or B, depending on the sensitivity of the information.
- Press “Done” in the window.
- Press “Add” again. You’ll be redirected to a page for your file.

Congrats, you’re done! You can copy the URL and send it to another team member if you need to share the file.

#### Viewing or modifying an existing file

- Navigate to the file’s page within your product sub-folder.
- Click “Download” to save it locally, to view or edit.
- If you’ve modified the file locally, click “Add version” to re-upload the file. Choose the file and press “Add Version”. GCDocs will add it as a new version.

As a best practice, **do not click either “Open” or “Edit”**. Changes may not save properly if you do.

### What we put on GCDocs
Any digital material that's [protected information]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy), including:
- Job interviewee notes or evaluations

### What we don't put in GCDocs
- Put non-protected files (like interview plans or project work) in [Google Drive]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive/).
- Store protected papers in our locked filing cabinet.
- Classified (like "secret" or "topic secret" documents) can't go in any of our systems or filing cabinets. Refer to TBS' guidance on handling it.

### Who uses GCDocs when
- **You are responsible for storing all files with protected information on your TBS computer or GCDocs.** Use GCDocs to securely store your files or to share them with other members of the Talent team.
