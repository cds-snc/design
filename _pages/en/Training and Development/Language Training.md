### General
Language Training is organized and administered by [TBS-Language Training Program](mailto:zztbsinh@tbs-sct.gc.ca) through [La Cité collégiale](https://www.collegelacite.ca/).  Typically, employees attend general classes organized by TBS, at a TBS office with a mix of people from various branches or attend classes at La Cite school located on Albert Street, Ottawa.

### Sign-up Process
When an employee is interested in Language Training, they are required to complete the [part-time training form](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11VHuli4KKciGr0BWizkiN1pNQiAfqHYY) as well as the [learning agreement](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11VHuli4KKciGr0BWizkiN1pNQiAfqHYY). Once completed, the forms are sent to Sana or the TBS language advisor (contacts listed at the end of this doc). A representative of La Cité collégiale will contact the employee to do an assessment, in person or over the phone.  Based on the employee’s level, they will be placed in a class. Class availabilities are as follows:

### Language Training at CDS
TBS Language Training offers French training specially organized for the CDS team.  A teacher is assigned for the CDS group.

As of March 2020, CDS is running 4 blocks of French training at various levels.  The classes run from Monday to Thursday.  Each employee attends 3 hours of French training. 1.5 hrs twice a week, (Mondays & Wednesdays, Tuesdays & Thursdays).  

**Learning Options at Ottawa Headquarters:**
* French Class at 219 Laurier Avenue: a class is formed when there are a minimum of 2 people at the same level, as assessed by La Cité collégiale.
* French Class at La Cité collégiale: if there are not enough people for a class to take place at the CDS office, employees may attend a class at La Cité collégiale.
 
**Learning Options for Distributed Employees:**
* If a distributed employee is assessed at a level at which a class is being offered at CDS, the employee can join-in virtually (Google Hangout). 
* If a distributed employee is assessed at a level that is NOT being offered at the CDS office, then the employee must wait until we have a second person at the same level.

**Alternative Options:**
* All employees are required to attend language training via one of the mechanisms listed above, however, under special circumstances, with the approval of their manager and the COO, distributed employees can choose to spend their training budget on classes offered locally from an accredited institution.
* Some employees have also opted to get a Rosetta Stone subscription, with the approval of their manager and the COO, using their training budget.

**_Note 1:_** An employee cannot attend a class virtually at La Cité collégiale because the school does not have virtual learning capabilities/options.

**_Note 2:_** Sana is currently working on encouraging the TBS Language Training Branch to extend their contract with La Cité collégiale to other cities so that distributed employees can attend language training without having to use their training budget. La Cité collégiale has branches across Canada. 

**Targeted Learning:**
* La Cité collégiale offers workshops to support employees who are looking to improve a specific language skill such as writing or speaking.
* Language training is offered on a [part-time](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11VHuli4KKciGr0BWizkiN1pNQiAfqHYY) or [full-time](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11VHuli4KKciGr0BWizkiN1pNQiAfqHYY) basis. Based on your need, you can discuss with your supervisor and explore your options.
