### Team vision
Talent makes HR stuff easy and intuitive for the CDS team. Our team is focused on providing an amazing experience to past, present and future CDS team members. This allows the CDS team to focus on the work of working with departments to change government to service people better.

This vision guides the objectives we set and key decisions we make.

### Objectives

Each quarter we (like all teams at CDS) set objectives and key results (or OKRs).
Objectives are overarching goals. Key results are concrete manifestations of each objective. Read more about the [origin of OKRs from Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/).

#### Current quarter objectives

* Hire the right people to make CDS successful.
* Iterate the Talent Function & Set the standard for the Government of Canada.
* Foster a strong, positive, and inclusive CDS culture based on data from the team.
* Research Talent as a Service.

We note progress on key results weekly and score them monthly. Watch our progress in the ðŸ”’[OKR progress tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15qK2h9FOPY7I3tXrbf6_OIuDjRUrxsJbiNFJuKnnPQ4/edit#gid=504851476).

#### How we set objectives quarterly

1. At the end of each quarter, we have a team retreat where:
 * we score the last quarter's objectives and key results. As a team, we give each key result a score between 0 and 1.
 * we reflect on (or "retro") the last quarter.
 * team members propose possible objectives for the coming quarter and we vote on them.
 * assign a "lead" to each of our objectives
2. Each objective lead then drafts a set of key results for that objective. They work with Andrea and the team to get feedback and objectives.
3. Then, the whole team meets with Aaron (chief executive officer) and Anatole (chief operating officer). We review last quarter's scores and this quarter's feedback.
4. Andrea then loads up an OKR tracking spreadsheet ðŸ”’ [like this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15qK2h9FOPY7I3tXrbf6_OIuDjRUrxsJbiNFJuKnnPQ4/edit#gid=504851476) for us to track progress.
